# Project Detail
1) Used react table
2) Table has inline editing using render function from the react table
3) Check box use on change function to submit change
4) Color column takes in the hex or color name as value to convert the background color
5) Top left above the table it has "+" to add the row
6) Each row has trash icon to delete the row
7) When the server start the data is inserted in the table.Also when there is no data server will insert the dummy row.

Change I would like to make
1) Make code more modular
2) Make add row use form or modal window rather then insert the empty row
