# Project Detail
1) Used react table
2) Table has inline editing using render function from the react table
3) Check box use on change function to submit change
4) Color column takes in the hex or color name as value to convert the background color
5) Top left above the table it has "+" to add the row
6) Each row has trash icon to delete the row
7) When the server start the data is inserted in the table.Also when there is no data server will insert the dummy row.

Change I would like to make
1) Make code more modular
2) Make add row use form or modal window rather then insert the empty row



# Plexxis Interview Exercise
## Requirements
Create a simple but __impressive__ (looks good, works well, has intuitive design, etc.) CRUD application that can do the following:

1) Retrieve employees from a REST API  
2) Display the employees in a React application  
3) Has UI mechanisms for creating and deleting employees  
4) Has API endpoints for creating and deleting employees  
5) Edit your version of the `README.md` file to explain to us what things you did, where you focussed your effort, etc.

*Read over the `Bonus` objectives and consider tackling those items as well*

## Bonus (Highly Encouraged)

1) Use a relational database to store the data (SQLite, MariaDB, Postgres)  
2) UI mechanisms to edit/update employee data  
3) Add API endpoint to update employee data  
4) Use [React Table](https://react-table.js.org)  

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The front-end app runs off localhost:3000. The REST API is located in the /server folder and runs off localhost:8080. The data is being served from a JSON file located in the /server/data folder. Run `npm start` to start both servers.

## Getting it Done
* You are free to use whatever libraries that you want. Be prepared to defend your decisions.
* There is no time limit. Use as little or as much time as is necessary to showcase your abilities.
* You should fork or clone our repository into your own repository.
  * Send us the link when you are done the exercise (pglinker at plexxis dot com).

If you do well on the test, we will bring you in for an interview. Your test results will be used as talking points.  

 __This is your chance to amaze us with your talent!__
